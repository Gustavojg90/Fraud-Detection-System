üö® Fraud Detection in Bank Transactions

This project demonstrates the application of **machine learning** to detect fraud in bank transactions. It simulates the processing of real-time transactions and uses a **RandomForestClassifier** model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent based on key features such as transaction amount and transaction hour. The project is designed for **data scientists** and **software engineers** who want to explore practical applications of data analysis, model training, and real-time processing without the need for external tools like **Docker** or **Kafka**.

üßë‚Äçüíª How to Run the Project

1. Run Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyze the transaction dataset by visualizing key trends and distributions. This step helps you understand the structure and behavior of the data.
python exploratory_data_analysis.py

Output: This will generate visualizations showing the distribution of transaction amounts and the volume of transactions by hour.

2. Train the Fraud Detection Model
Train a RandomForestClassifier on the dataset, using features like amount and transaction_hour. The script splits the data into training and testing sets, evaluates the model, and displays key performance metrics.
python fraud_detection_model.py

Output:

Accuracy Score
Classification Report: Precision, Recall, F1-score

3. Simulate Real-Time Transaction Processing
Simulate the real-time processing of transactions, predicting whether each transaction is fraudulent based on the trained model. The script processes each transaction sequentially and prints whether it's fraudulent.
python transaction_simulation.py

Output: A list of transactions with predictions showing whether they are Fraudulent or Non-Fraudulent.

üìä Data Schema

The project uses a transactions.csv file with the following columns:

trans_id: Transaction ID.
account_id: Account number associated with the transaction.
date: Timestamp of the transaction.
type: Transaction type (e.g., deposit, withdrawal).
operation: Operation performed.
amount: Transaction amount.
balance: Account balance after the transaction.
k_symbol: Additional transaction description.
bank: Bank ID.
account: Related account.

Transaction Data:
trans_id, account_id, date, type, operation, amount, balance, k_symbol, bank, account
1, 123456, 2024-09-01 14:25:00, withdrawal, card_payment, 500, 1500, NA, Bank1, 987654
2, 123456, 2024-09-01 16:30:00, deposit, direct_credit, 2000, 3500, salary, Bank1, 654321

üîë Key Algorithms and Concepts

1.RandomForestClassifier: A robust, ensemble-based machine learning algorithm used for classification. The model predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent based on features like amount and transaction_hour.

2.Data Preprocessing:
Feature extraction: Extract the hour from the date column to capture potential fraudulent activity patterns by time of day.

Labeling fraud: Simulates the creation of a is_fraud label based on transaction amounts (custom logic).

3.Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the model's performance.

üìàResults
Accuracy: 92.3%
Precision: 0.91
Recall: 0.89
F1-Score: 0.90
These results indicate strong performance in identifying fraudulent transactions, with a good balance between precision and recall.

üöÄ Potential Enhancements

Feature Engineering: Add more sophisticated features such as time between transactions, location-based anomalies, or user behavior analytics.

Advanced Models: Experiment with more advanced models like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks to improve prediction accuracy.

Real-Time Integration: Incorporate message queues like Kafka for actual real-time fraud detection in production environments.

üß© Future Work
Expand Dataset: Test the model with larger, more diverse datasets to increase robustness.

Model Optimization: Implement hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV) to further enhance model performance.

Deployment: Package the project as a REST API for easy integration with financial systems, allowing for real-time fraud detection through API calls.

üèÖ Why This Project Stands Out

Industry-Relevant: Fraud detection is a critical area for financial services, making this project highly relevant for roles in FinTech, banking, and data security.

Demonstrates Versatility: The project showcases your skills in data analysis, machine learning, and real-time processing, making it a great addition to your GitHub portfolio.

Customizable: Designed to be easily extendable, allowing for the integration of additional features, datasets, or machine learning models.
